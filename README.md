### Check your email w/o a web browser!
##  By:Joseph Huaynate

# Summary 
###Gmail is what I use to check my email but sometimes there is too much clutter and I just wish to check who is sending me what and what exactly do they want. And thanks to RSS feeds, we can parse the RSS feed with the sender's name and the email's subject. Although this is just the intial step, I do want to be able to read the email and as well as respond to the sender. 

### Prerequisites
- Have your username and password* for gmail at hand because you will need them.
	   *(If your Gmail account has two factor authentication active then you will need to get an App Password throught this link: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
Next you will go to How to generate an App password. Once created, this will be your password for your Gmail account)
	
- Have curl installed. curl command is a tool to download or tranfser files/data from or to a server using FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, SMB and other supported protocols on Linux or Unix-like
system. 
  If curl is NOT installed: sudo apt install curl

- Understanding of sed command: SED command in UNIX stands for 'stream editor' and it can perform many functions on a file, such as, search, find, replace, insert, deletion. With SED you can edit files even without opening it. It also supports regular expressions, which allows for complex pattern matching.
